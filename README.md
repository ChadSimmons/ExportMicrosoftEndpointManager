# ExportMicrosoftEndpointManager
A solution to export configurations and objects from Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Intune, and more.

Version 1 will consist of a single script to export the majority of interesting ConfigMgr objects.

Version 2 will add or reference solutions that do the same for Intune and related solutions

Version 3 will turn this into a PowerShell module

Please feel free to contribute to the project.  One guiding principle is that it shouldn't turn into a documentation script.  Paul Wetter's documentation script (https://github.com/paulwetter/DocumentConfigMgrCB) is fantastic and could also use some community investment.
